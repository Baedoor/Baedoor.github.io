        <p id="vc"> First of all, there are two important notes:    </p>
            <ul id="vc">
                <li> Whatever you contribute, you give permission to me to use this asset indefinitely and in all possible contexts. Read <a href="https://github.com/Toma400/The_Isle_of_Ansur/wiki/Assets-Contribution-Principles">here</a> for details </li>
                <li> You cannot contribute anything generated by AI, at any point of pipeline </li>
            </ul>
        <p id="vc">
            With those two points covered, let's try to point you how it's possible to contribute, and what should you do. Find category below you are interested in and
            give a read of its guidelines.
        </p>

                <td>
                    Baedoor Travels is in need of pixel artist - ideally, one who can stay for longer time with the project, helping with art style coherency.<br>
                    Aimed atmosphere for those project is moody, semi-realistic and should stray away from pastel vibrancy, unless the area covered by game is
                    deliberately having this design.<br>
                    To become pixel artist, <a href="https://discord.gg/GbTw9KqnrE"> Discord server </a> and ask for further instructions. Providing example of your work will be useful, too.

                <td>
                    Both Baedoor and Emperor of Eternity will need 3D artists, though the style aimed will be slightly different.<br>
                    Baedoor game will basically require you to follow style very similar to Morrowind/Tamriel Rebuilt, including HD versions of those. Learning
                    techniques of this modding scene will help you, as there's high chance I will follow all technicals of this game very closely.<br>
                    EoE is meant to have smaller pieces, more focused on architecture and nature, probably also with lighter, less moody tone.<br>
                    There is no design doc or consensus on any of those projects, but you can train yourself by trying to make Morrowind models, but keep them
                    in .blender format.<br>
                    To try your skills in 3D, <a href="https://discord.gg/GbTw9KqnrE"> join Discord server </a>. You will be given choice to try one of model requests
                    from private <a href="https://github.com/Toma400/OSAM_Data/issues">OSAM repository</a> that is place where currently all models are kept
                    in one place.<br>
                    Successfully passing two model requests will give you modeller role and I will open OSAM repository for you.

                    Right now, there are quests being designed for <a href="https://github.com/Toma400/The_Isle_of_Ansur"> Isle of Ansur </a>. Requirement for
                    quest developer here would be to get accustomed with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wnqy_b-xHs4IbnqHv82h26AEgCbl5CMJRfnHfu8j8QI"> Ansur lore </a>
                    and to prepare the quest <i>including</i> all the NPC lines.<br>
                    In the future, in-game implementation may be also a requirement, but currently it is enough to design the idea with all additional writing work.<br>
                    <br>
                    In addition, you can also write books on Baedoor lore. This, however, would need tight cooperation with me, as there is very little lore that is
                    set in stone, or even possible to read anywhere on Internet.<br>

                    Currently, there's no specific need for translations, however this will be important part of future development.<br>
                    The only case of needed translation contribution is <a href="https://github.com/Toma400/The_Isle_of_Ansur_PL"> Polish translation for Isle of Ansur </a>
                    that was separated from main project because of how much time it took me to maintain it.<br>
                    You can maintain it by following modders resources for main project and creating PR to update language files to recent versions.

                    If you know low-level programming, especially aimed on game development and creating 3D rendering libraries, it would be most lovely for
                    you to join <a href="https://discord.gg/GbTw9KqnrE"> Discord server </a>. I will explain what can be done with that.<br>
                    With more high-level knowledge, there's currently no need for code contributions. This may change in the future, however.

                    Concept artist is one of more needed contributions currently, since a lot of worldbuilding right now needs visualisation and creative take on
                    imagery. If you like to draw and want to help the project through it, please join <a href="https://discord.gg/GbTw9KqnrE"> Discord server </a>.
                    I will guide you further then.
