                                The Book of Seth initially planned as "trashbin" of ideas and place for my amateurish experiments

                                While this is technically still true, I started treating it more like regular
                                project, also given nowadays almost all music made by me is under this alias.<br>
                                The current plan is to finish all albums I planned for TBoS and include all music that I do in
                                the meantime out of pure will, and then move into second experimental project with less quality

                                Single I made in 2022 as outcome of me coming back to Elder Scrolls.
                                Playing Beyond Skyrim's Bruma expansion, I saw the name of Sancre Tor,
                                which brought me to read about this place.<br>
                                Being quite fascinated with its lore, I decided to honour it with the song
                                about the events happening there - as the song is instrumental, I tried
                                to use sounds to bring symbolism as tool of narration.

                                being entirely pre-built instead of manually played.<br>
                                Thanks to that, it is the only part of the series that is publicly
                                available and which I consider actually good. It brings a lot of
                                nice atmosphere which I always like to include in my music.

                                On 3rd March 2021 I released new version of the album, trying to fix

                                Similarly to two other albums from early 2020, this represents rather poor technical
                                skills of mine - here also supported by vocal parts that I always felt awkward about.

                                First demo I attempted under new alias - trying to make it sound like jam live session,
                                but the eventual outcome turned to be quite bad, ruining any potential songs could have.<br>
                                Last song felt interesting to the point that reworked "studio" version was later put
                                on unreleased compilation, and third one I think was released on another album under
                                different name.
