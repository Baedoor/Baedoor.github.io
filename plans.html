                <h2>Baedoor Travels</h2>
                Somehow of a prequel for later Baedoor game, BT would convey similar aim for immersivity and old-school, but within pixel art
                style and slightly different medium being 2.5D graphics.
                It would take place in different timeline than main game, and in more oriental areas, to complement the lore.

                <h2>Emperor of Eternity</h2>
                End goal of my love for strategy games. It would be heavily economic-aimed RTS that would take a lot of inspirations from
                Sierra's citybuilders, such as Emperor (to which EoE's name is tribute for), but placing them in much more massive map of Baedoor universe,
                and allowing you to rule over multiple cities, as an empire.

                <h2>Baedoor</h2>
                My ultimate dream game. Following old-school aesthetics and mechanics similar to Morrowind, it would offer improved experience
                whenever I see fit - such as fight and survival/sim immersivity.<br>
                It will be developed indefinitely, with goal of completing whole universe.
