                    <b>Spires of Baedoor</b> is second Baedoor mod for Minecraft, which similarly to Civilisations branched off of ideas
                    that were meant to be included in Wastelands originally - but were seen as too broad for steampunk mod to include.<br>
                    Spires were made to include Baedoor magic in the world of Minecraft, and also as outcome of fascination with
                    Electroblob's Wizardry and other 1.12 magic mods I really liked. Additionally, with time I also decided that there
                    could be more fun way to play with herbalism, so the second aspect of the mod would be to have more in-depth
                    gameplay for gathering, researching and using plants.<br>
                    <br>
                    While currently on hold, Spires is considered as one of mods I still want to do at some point in the future. Some ideas
                    conceptualised for the mod were actually reintroduced in Baedoor lore - so even if the mod were to never publicly
                    appear, the ideas on magic will probably do in all Baedoor games planned.
