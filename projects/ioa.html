                    <b>Isle of Ansur</b> is my first massive RPG project, started in 27th September 2021: initially as a simple remake of my
                    old terminal game, Between Shadows and Light.<br>
                    Time passed and it was getting clear that this game has potential for much more, therefore it should be moved to graphical
                    design instead.<br>
                    <br>
                    The aim of Isle of Ansur is to offer similarly open world as in all RPG games going forward - you should be able to wander
                    around and just explore the lore. The game itself is meant to be first real insight into the world of Baedoor, being located
                    in eponymous Ansur isle, fairly peaceful place visited by merchants and outlanders everyday.<br>
                    <br>
                    IoA development took such long time mostly due to being my first serious project, in time when I wasn't as fluent in coding
                    as I am today - thus, resulting in me rewriting the code few times to adjust it to better (current) standards.<br>
                    The project itself is also kinda going through burnout stages, since I work on it alone. And it needs a lot of resources,
                    which makes me question sometimes how much this work will pay up.<br>
                    That being said, with those up and downs - the development still goes forwards and is meant to eventually be completed.
                    However, this project is still considered a backburner for <a href="https://baedoor.github.io/todo/b3d.html">
                    Baedoor game</a> being the main focus currently.
                </p>
                <h1 id="vc">How can you help?</h1>
                <p id="vc">
                    Currently, the biggest need is <b>concept art</b> and <b>quest writing</b>. The first one would be immensely helpful especially
                    if you would be inclined to help on long run - drawing images for every location in coherent artstyle, following lore fairly
                    closely. This means eventually you are tasked with around hundred of environmental art to make, but span across few years of
                    completing whole game area.<br>
                    Quest writing, in the other hand, would require to write the idea of a quest <i>and</i> all dialogues needed, including branching
                    of the quest via important quest decisions - this will let those quests be implemented fairly quickly once whole framework
                    for them is done.
