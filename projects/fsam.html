                    <b>From Steam and Magic</b> is upcoming mod for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind that adds new landmass you can reach through use of special ring.<br>
                    The island of Disane let you enter a small society from another universe and dive into their complex traditions and struggles.<br>
                    Mod itself is meant as a teaser for larger project, being <a href="../todo/b3d.html">Morrowind-like RPG game</a> developed simultaneously.
                </p>
                <h1 id="vc">How can you help?</h1>
                <p id="vc">
                    Currently, two biggest needs of the mod is conceptualisation for lore and asset development - both of which you can help! <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Conceptualisation</b><br>
                    If anything in project's lore catch your interest - landscapes, race depictions, creatures, flora, specific persona, symbolism, items...
                    simply draw them! The more accurate you will try to be (for example by asking about details), the more useful the piece will be.<br>
                    This kind of work is highly appreciated, as a lot of worldbuilding parts lack dedicated visual depiction.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Asset Development</b><br>
                    FSAM requires assets listed <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n9J29Gv2123Rr7CzHAIoDwG_YXn4sdMDTZlSR8IcOMM">here</a>
                    - willing asset developer is free to take any of those after previously consulting the choice on Discord server.
                    It's worth noting however that lack of concept art may need more frequent updates on the asset, since model
                    not following certain depiction may be sent back for adjustments.<br>
                    Additionally, asset developer is asked to not only provide textures and models in Morrowind-friendly format (.nif for model, .dds/.tga for
                    textures and icons), but also is required to include "clean" files (.blend for model, .png for textures and icons). This is because all
                    FSAM assets will most likely be reused for <a href="../todo/b3d.html">Baedoor game</a> in the future.<br>
                    <br>
                    Interior, exterior and quest developers will be useful at later date, but will require to pass the process of learning the tools for this task.<br>
                    Promotions granted on Project Tamriel/Tamriel Rebuilt can be transferred over to the FSAM development.
