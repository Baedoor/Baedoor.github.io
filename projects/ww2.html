                                <b>WW2</b> is my first ever mod I was making back in 2012, for Battle of Wesnoth game. It adds several
                                factions and tons of units related to World War II - or, to be more specific, taken from World of Tanks
                                franchise.<br>
                                <br>
                                The genesis of the mod is quite silly, as I made it to motivate my father to play with me - he is great
                                fan of strategies, yet I couldn't convince him to play BfW because of its fantasy vibes. Therefore the
                                mod idea was born.
                            </p>

                            <p id="vc">
                                WW2 wasn't touched by me since 2012 or 2013 - its last version was a while ago. I wasn't really keeping
                                good organisation back then, therefore now it's hard for me to go back and immediately know what to do.<br>
                                However, I was working on new version for the mod back then, shuffling some units around and making
                                balance changes. I wanted to add some new mechanics, as well as Italian and Japanese units then - nowadays,
                                with World of Tanks having those nations, the latter is even easier.<br>
                                <br>
                                I will at some point finalise this "forever-indev" update. Once this is done, I want to do major overhaul
                                for the mod, drawing all units, so it is possible for me to not feel guilty for using copyrighted material.<br>
                                In addition, this will make the mod be able to stand on its own legs - without any legal caveats, it will
                                be added to BfW mods system, and just have nice dedicated assets.<br>
                                It is a plan for later time, though - I want to finish more projects before I derail myself to the ones
                                that are already playable.
