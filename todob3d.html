                    <b>Baedoor</b> is ultimately the game I dreamed about since childhood. The ideas from back then were polished and expanded
                    over time, to eventually reach the conclusion that what I imagined as perfect RPG should be immersive in very subtle way - in
                    great extent, Morrowind with its province mods and Ashfall being perfect example.<br>
                    Morrowind aesthetical style and a lot of oldschool mechanics are also what draws me towards the idea of making my game very much
                    follow the same design - and, maybe even make Morrowind plugins work with Baedoor as seamless experience?<br>
                    <br>
                    The differences between TES3 and Baedoor would be that I would like to take advantage of new engine to polish mechanics I dislike
                    in Morrowind, and expand upon things that Elder Scrolls universe doesn't. I want to see much more "real time" travels as option to
                    pick when you pick quick travel; I want to be able to see much more detailed cities without being nightmare to performance;
                    I want to see fight that is more dynamic, similarly to first Mount & Blade (1866 mod ideally).<br>
                    I also want to see Baedoor lore improve upon the universe versatility even more.<br>
                    <br>
                    Baedoor - as it is currently planned - should take place in New Era. It is very interesting time period, because it covers all possible
                    technological diversity in the universe: heavily advanced, late steampunk New Baedoor, industrialised areas of East Baedoor and Jitado,
                    early adopters such as Teqqueir or Eimr, cyberpunkish Second Ghloddish Empire, technological experiments on Arennan - but also very
                    tech-savvy Moon tris and plenty of civilisations that didn't get into technology at all, but developed their own ways to fight and
                    survive.<br>
                    <br>
                    The geographical plan of this project is to bring two opposite places to life - magical island of Khacari, and industrialised capital
                    of Baedoor. The first location would be starting point to hook player to the lore without overscoping, and second one would bring the
                    game out of beta, allowing you to see steampunk influences in full glory. The game would develop indefinitely, to bring more areas
                    into life and eventually (but realistically not possible in my life) whole universe.<br>
                    Just like in Baedoor Travels plan, player wouldn't be a hero or anyone important - just regular commonfolk trying to find their path
                    in this universe. This opens up a lot of ways to interact with the world that traditional RPGs often miss.<br>
                    The same way as in Baedoor Travels, main quest would be replaced with guild questlines and focus on atmosphere instead.
