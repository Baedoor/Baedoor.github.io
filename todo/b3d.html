                    <b>Baedoor</b> is my ultimate dream game I wanted to make ever since childhood. It is meant to be open-world, immersive RPG in a vein
                    of games like TES3: Morrowind, Arcanum or Red Dead Redemption 2. It will follow old-school character, both through mechanics and
                    aesthetics.<br>
                    <br>
                    The game will take place in my own steampunk/fantasy universe, Baedoor, in which you will be able to become anyone. You can pick the usual
                    route of becoming an adventurer or fighter, but the goal of this game will be to give you absolute freedom, in which settling down somewhere
                    or picking any other profession not involving typical RPG gameplay is just as interesting. You want to buy a house and create your own
                    inn, become a simple newspaper man, or invest in trading company and sail with them to foreign ports? You should be able to!<br>
                    Game itself won't include any particular story, as the world around you doesn't treat you specially - you can become whoever you want, but
                    don't expect being the one saving the world. And saving the world isn't as easy as killing the dragon, mind you.<br>
                    <br>
                    The ultimate goal of this project is to bring entirety of my universe to life - however, this (impossible) goal will be taken bit by bit,
                    focusing on finishing small areas every release and allowing community to contribute, so areas can come to life faster.<br>
                    <br>
                    Currently, the game is in early development stage where it is mostly worked on conceptually and technical backbone of it is slowly prepared.
