                    <b>Baedoor</b> is ultimately the game I dreamed about since childhood. The ideas from back then were polished and expanded
                    over time, to eventually reach the conclusion that what I imagined as perfect RPG should be immersive in very subtle way - in
                    great extent, Morrowind with its province mods and Ashfall being perfect example.<br>
                    Morrowind aesthetical style and a lot of oldschool mechanics are also what draws me towards the idea of making my game very much
                    follow similar design - and, maybe even make Morrowind plugins work with it as seamless experience?<br>
                    <br>
                    Currently, the game is in early development stage where it is mostly worked on conceptually.
