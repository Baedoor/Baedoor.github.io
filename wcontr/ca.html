            Concept art is currently the most important need for all projects. A lot of worldbuilding lacks heavily
            in visual representation of ideas, making it harder to push for any practical work without clear
            direction on how textual part of lore is represented.

                    Generally, Baedoor lore concepting is invaluable for all projects and the worldbuilding itself
                    to progress forwards. The universe itself has a lot of places that lack on visual representation
                    to complement textual ideas and make the area feel complete.<br>
                    <br>
                    All kind of concept arts are welcome - landscapes, architecture, characters, weapons, fauna, flora,
                    technological inventions, all sorts of weirdness. The point of concept art is not necessarily
                    quality and so you shouldn't be afraid to post things that are not good enough in your mind - if
                    they portray something not covered earlier and are accurate enough, they will make really good
                    contribution.

                    Isle of Ansur is in most dire situation when it comes to imagery.<br>
                    I imagined that this game will eventually have all landscape images drawn by me, but with
                    time harsh realisation came that I'm not yet skilled enough to put quality work out there.<br>
                    And the quantity of images needed even for the smallest release plan is quite big.<br>
                    <br>
                    IoA would need ideally contributor who is willing to make plenty of art for locations - maybe also
                    supplementary ones for race avatars and items, but that's more side need that can be covered
                    independently.<br>
                    Either way, contributing to the project would be most appreciated if it was planned
                    to be on the long run - as art coherency is quite important need for the project.
