        <h1 class="colw"> Copyrights </h1>
        <p id="vc">
            Contributing to my creations, you are allowing me (Toma400) and the team working on these projects to use your work anytime, anywhere, even after leaving
            the community.<br>
            You also allow us to edit, modify, or remove your work to suit needs of my projects, including those made in the future.<br>
            All creations of contributors will be distributed publicly in either dedicated project, asset repository, Baedoor Encyclopaedia, website showcase or
            in another form.
            <br><br>
            Aside of points above, you still retain all control over your creations as copyright allows - you can freely use it in another project or portfolio.
        </p><br><br>
        <h1 class="colw"> Workflow </h1>
        <p id="vc">
            All contributed work needs to be your own and use only resources you have rights for. In addition, certain creations will need to follow specific design
            principles and may go through review process to ensure the standards are met.
        </p><br><br>

        <h1 class="colw"> AI Usage </h1>
        <p id="vc">
            Any usage of generative AI applications or features is prohibited and can be a sole reason to deny your contribution. It is motivated both by the fact
            that such resources do not meet the required licensing trust established by law (so don't take companies' word on that) and because of ethical stance
            my projects will follow. If you deal with what I make, you can trust it will be entirely human-made.
