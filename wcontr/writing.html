            Writing is currently the biggest helping task to prepare current two developed projects smoothly to
            their finishing stages.<br>
            Even though I consider myself fairly decent with writing, it is one of art fields that takes a lot of time
            to produce something of great quality. Additionally, English isn't my native language, which makes it
            harder for me to produce something of equal quality if I were writing in my own. And the amount of writing
            needed for all project is fairly massive.

                    IoA is game that relies incredibly heavy on writing, being text RPG. This means
                    that it needs a lot of dialogues and writing that will fill its open world, ideally
                    coming from different writers even.<br>

                    Wastelands mod is in big need of Patchouli book with its upcoming updates. While not
                    technically essential for release, it provides all required knowledge about the mod
                    within game experience.<br>
                    <br>
                    Contributor of this resource should know at least minimally <a href="https://vazkiimods.github.io/Patchouli/docs/intro">
                    Patchouli book system</a>, to be able to fluently build the guide book. Knowledge on
                    mod's contents (ideally from versions before 1.20.1) is also heavily appreciated, as
                    it will make communication on resources much quicker.
