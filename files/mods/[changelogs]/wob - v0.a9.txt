Weapon Types:
* Sabre - attacks are much faster than with sword
          you can block attacks by holding right-click, but it also
          disables your attack (planned: animation & no attack allowed)
* Knife - first attack comes with additional damage or effect
          after that it needs to reset itself (check cooldown by right-click)
* Spear - when holding shield in off-hand, right-clicking gives you short resistance II
          boost

Ranged Characteristics:
* Dagger - 20 ticks, stacking in 16 (can be poisoned) | dmg: 3
* Axe - 30 ticks, stacking in 8 | dmg: 3/4/6 (bone/stone/iron)
* Javelin - 60 ticks, stacking in 4 | dmg: 4/6 (bone/stone)

Plants:
* Tsua Flower
      - can be bonemealed to obtain more
      - crafting it further gives you 'star of rising day'
      - 'star of rising day' can give you ink sack if used in 2x2 pattern

Blocks:
* Block of Mushroom Poison
* Leghold Trap
  -> use tripwire hook to activate, deactivate and release it
  -> in activated mode, it catches entities
  -> you need to release trap to let caught entity go
  -> breaking trap in active or caught state is extremely long, 
     but with diamond pickaxe you can do that

Items:
* Javelin Sack
  -> you can store there your javelins
  -> right-click with filled sack to unload

* Winfleton's Diamond Ace Card (collectible, not in survival yet)
* Winfleton's Heart Ace Card (collectible, not in survival yet)
* Winfleton's Club Ace Card (collectible, not in survival yet)
* Winfleton's Spade Ace Card (collectible, not in survival yet)

* Lefs 9 Infantry Revolver Scheme
* Windsweeper Scheme

Advancements:
* Entering Wastelands of Baedoor
  -> gives you recipes for all crafting table items/blocks available in mod
* Hunter of Lost Woods (Hunter Path - Beginning)
  -> hidden; granted when you craft javelin, bow, throwing knife or throwing axe
* Let the Hunt Begin (Hunter Path)
  -> hidden; granted when you create your first javelin sack
* Trapping the Beast (Hunter Path)
  -> granted when you place your first leghold trap
* Ace of Winfleton's
  -> granted while having all 4 aces of Winfleton's Deck in inventory
  -> in future version, will be parented to boss path

Effects:
* Curare Poison
  -> makes you unable to walk and weak your attacks strongly (16/8 hearts)
  -> currently not obtainable without commands

Gameplay:
* Descriptions on some items, blocks and weapons

                              CHANGES:
Weapons Mechanics:
* Sabre weapon type now has defence mechanics (holding right-click disables
  damage, but also make you unable to attack)
* Crocodile Shotgun shot delay lenghtened to 40 ticks
* Elephant Gun reload delay changed to 90 ticks

Nether Avoider Mechanics:
* Nether Avoider now kills also items related to mobs it kills
* If powered by redstone, Nether Avoider is pulsating even if inactive
  (this means you can activate it for certain situations, also without
   your direct action)
* Nether Avoider Pulsating effect shortened to 3 seconds, to make you realise
  quicker that you are outside its range

Items Mechanics:
* right-clicking mushroom poison no more gives you poison effect
* right-clicking mushroom poison poisons arrow, if you had it in inventory
  (what means poison tipped arrows obtainable much easier)

Naming:
* Thrown Dagger renamed to 'Throwing Dagger', same with poisoned one
  -> ID tags remained the same, though
* Gun Barrel, Shotgun Barrel and Double Shotgun Barrel renamed to 'Short', 
  'Long' and 'Double Long' Barrel. 
  -> ID tags remained the same, though
* Nether Avoider (Inactive) renamed to simply 'Nether Avoider'

Textures:
* Ammunition Boxes texture changed
* Lapis and Dark Lapis Crystals texture changed (standard state)

Other:
* Messages are now shown as a golden overlay, instead of chat messages

                              BUGFIXES:
* BA9s0022 - elephant gun had wrong reload time
