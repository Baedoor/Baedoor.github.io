Dedicated for: Forge 1.16.5, Forge 1.18
------------------------------------------------------------------
This version introduces start of 1.18 version of Civilisations,
made entirely in code. 1.18 version progress may be slower than
1.16, but it will try to provide similar features, depending on
my coding abilities. Hopefully it will also introduce better
generation using 1.18 features.

1.18 version will be less supportive towards tooltips for simple
items, considering them being explained in Patchouli.

_________
------------------------------------------------------------------
1.18 version is designed to work for 1.18.1. 1.18.2 version should
work, but may be unstable (and as I tested myself, will crash when
bonemealing trees), so I'd not recommend using it as of yet.
