Dedicated for: Forge 1.16.5, Forge 1.18
------------------------------------------------------------------
This version introduces start of 1.18 version of Civilisations,
made entirely in code. 1.18 version progress may be slower than
1.16, but it will try to provide similar features, depending on
my coding abilities. Hopefully it will also introduce better
generation using 1.18 features.

1.18 version will be less supportive towards tooltips for simple
items, considering them being explained in Patchouli.

_________
v0.a2b can be considered "fixing & small new stuff update", since
all elements added in this update are rather small, but necessary.

v0.a3 will be further fixing and - hopefully - new generation,
by this meaning new biomes and structures, also with new features.

1.18 version is for now very poor version of 1.16 one, but this
will change in v0.a2c/v0.a3.
Patchouli guide for this release is not updated.

                               ADDED:

    Temporarily enabled bonemealing/growth of the trees. It will
    probably be broken, so use with caution. Any reports of bugs
		     are highly appreciated!

Blocks:
* Lais Woodset
* Dune Coal Block
* Added some missing types for esrah woodset (button, pressure plate)
* Cirtain ore 
  - generates below y=35, it spawns 1 ore/chunk
  - you need to place campfire below the ore to mine it (diamond or higher tier of pickaxe)
    -> campfire can be up to five blocks below the ore
    -> heat sources are supported by "cobr:cirtain_heaters" tag
    -> while adding new elements to the tag, remember that lore-wise it is smoke making cirtain easier to get by mining

Items:
* Cirtain nugget and scrap
  - Cirtain nugget can be crafted into cirtain ingot (WoB integration)
  - Smelting nugget or ore will turn them into a scrap
    -> smelting takes 1.5x longer time, unless you use blast furnace

Dimensions and Biomes:
* Tertenic Dunes
* Tertenic Dunes Edge
  - both biomes are not spawning at the moment, but will in future versions

Mechanics:
* Message system allowing player to see aesthetical pop-ups instead of chat messages

Items:
* Cirtain nugget
* Cirtain scrap

Advancements:
* That Priceless Gem
  - given after player gets cirtain nugget

Integrations:
* You can craft bamboo mats from Cultural Delights now using eotic bamboo


			      CHANGED:
Blocks:
* Civilisation Table
  -> textures revamped
  -> now it is not pushed by piston
  -> changed some parameters to match wooden block more

Mechanics:
* Dimension-related
  -> Removed fast travelling to Dunes and Overworld
  -> Added a way to obtain Evergreen Depths Traveller Stone (use vine to change empty traveller stone into Evergreen Depths variant!)

Fixes:
* Fixed leaves' loot tables, so they now drop correct things (leaves/saplings/sticks)
* Corrected tool requirements for mining blocks
* Fixed some incorrect recipes and missing tags
* Other small fixes
