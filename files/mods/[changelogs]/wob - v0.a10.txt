Gameplay:

Mechanics:
* Sabre Weapons Tier
  -> introduced sabre experience
     * raises after each critical hit dealt with any sabre to enemy
     * raises after each five successful sabre defences
  -> introduced chance to self-harm while attacking (self-harm damage is half damage of an attack)
  -> chance of self-harm decreases with more sabre experience (mastering it to specific number decreases self-harm chance to 0%)

  -> to set sabre experience, use scoreboard "sabre_experience"

* Firearm Experience
  -> granted after shooting (jammed shooting counts)
  -> helps with avoiding gun jamming and improve accuracy
  -> to set firearm experience, use scoreboard "gun_experience"

  -------
  Firearm Jamming
  -> jams firearm while trying to fire; the chance of that depends on quality of firearm, player experience and Cylinder Inspection enchantment
  -> jamming chance formula:
                             quality * 10 / CI enchantment * experience

      [ quality: handmade firearms (2), schemed firearms (1)
      [ experience: decreasing from 0.9 to 0 (reaching 500 level results with 0)

  -------
  Accuraccy - make your head move a bit after each shoot. It uses degree value, from formula:

                               (aim_penalty * experience * googles) / 2

      [ aim_penalty: default 20, reduced with Stabilisation enchantment (values: 10, 7, 5); shotguns have end value bigger of 2
      [ experience: decreasing from 0.9 to 0 (reaching 500 level results with 0)
      [ googles: if used, value is 1/2 (gogles not introduced in this version)


* Ormath Reputation
  -> tribe reputation (bound to each tribe & shaman)
     * reputation limit is 250 points
     * each hit reduces tribe reputation for 25
     * tribe becomes agressive after reaching -50 reputation value (default is 0)
       -> loyal friendship with shaman doesn't preserve you from that penalty
     * you can raise your reputation by trade
     * if any ormath is killed by player, tribe reputation drop for 275 points
       -> you won't be punished only after getting almost reputation limit
     * if shaman is killed, tribe becomes hostile immediately; it doesn't matter if it's player killing shaman
       -> reputation drops for 500

* Renewablity
  -> End Stone (by Glistering Ash/Sand/Clay, via shaman trades, aggro shaman or wind spirit farm)
  -> Clay (via ormath trades)
  -> Wither Rose (via shaman trades)
  -> Jungle Wood (via ormath trades)
  -> Soul Sand (via Nether Soul Essence)
  -> Soul Soil
  -> Shulker Box (via using Rod of the Winds)

* Quick Single reload type
  -> you still need to reload bullets one-by-one, but you can reload during cooldown (meaning you can reload faster)
  -> technically it's just reload button enabling after about 35% of a reload time

* Nether Avoider
  -> it now has Reaper mode, enabled through commands
     * on Reaper mode, Avoider kills any living entity except player 
       (intended as back-compatibility feature, enabling universal cross-mod integration in exchange for radical use)
  -> it has counterpart block, "Avoider_Block" obtainable via commands; it serves as a transparent alternative
     * it doesn't use Reaper mode
