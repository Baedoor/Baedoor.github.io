Dedicated for: Forge 1.16.5

CoB is recreated, meaning old version is not compatibile with second
Updating the versions though should not impact the world, except for
big sandy veils missing.

Also, Patchouli and Farmer's Delight are two mods considered 
coherently integrated, meaning that all their features will be not 
considered as typical compatibility, but rather as native feature
of a mod. Same goes for other Baedoor mods (WoB, SoB and OoB).

To get into the Dunes, you only need to craft traveller stone and
igniter for now, but igniter recipe is placeholder for later
different method of getting it. If you do not want to cheese the game
by developer-aimed easing, wait for v0.a3/v0.a4 which will add whole
separate way of getting Scroll of the Dunes.

                               ADDED:
Blocks:
* Esrah Wood & most basic variants for it
* Travellers Stone (with four dimensional variants)
* Eotic Bamboo-related blocks:
  - Pack of Eotic Bamboo (storage block)
  - Bamboo Blocks (aesthetical) with variants such as slabs, stairs and carpets
* Dune Sand & its variants (bright, wet, sandstone & sandstone bricks variations)
  - Part of future world generation
* Hardened Sand & Dune Sand
* Dune Sandstone and vanilla Sandstone ores (coal, iron)
  - vanilla ores will be retextured in v0.a3, current textures serve as a placeholder
  - dune sandstone ores don't generate yet, they will spawn in their own biomes in v0.a3
* Civilisation Table

Weapons:
* Bone Shortsword
  - dmg: 6
  - durability: 240
  - speed: 1.5
  - inflicts slowness I for 2 seconds after hitting
* Bone Sabre
  - dmg: 6
  - durability: 140
  - speed: 2.4
  - inflicts slowness I for 2 seconds after hitting
  If WoB installed:
  - uses sabre mechanics
  - craftable with cracked bones

Plants:
* Eotic Bamboo
* Esrah Tree
  -> can be planted with use of esrah sapling
  -> esrah sapling and leaves subtly glow
  -> growth and bonemealing disabled due to issues related to it; hopefully it will be fixed in v0.a3
  -> esrah leaves loot tables are bugged too, so I don't recommend cutting down the trees and wait for a fix, if you want to replant them

Dimensions and Biomes:
* Dunes {dim}
  -> Dry Lands - wastelandy biome with rare oasis generating
  -> Eotic Lakes - desert lake biome with eotic bamboos growing

Mechanics:
* Beginnings of Empire and Hiring system made (only as hidden code, no impact on gameplay or data yet though) 
  -> system will be controlled by "cobr_data" folder (later in dev: moved to /saves/ specific folder) and specific scoreboard teams
     - files from cobr_data folder should not be removed/changed, as it can cause corrupting the saves

Structures:
* Oases
* Mercenary Camp (Terten)
  -> spawn rarely in Dunes
  -> from time to time, terten civil spawns there

Mobs:
* White Lizard
  -> the only one naturally spawning mob in Dunes at the moment
* Terten Civil
  -> added mostly as testing mob for further (v0.a3 most probably) hiring mechanics
  -> unequipped at the moment
  -> spawns on rare mercenary camps

Food:
* Lizard meat (+ cooked)
  -> dropped by lizards
* Lizard stew
  -> made out of resources you will be able to find in Dunes
  -> FD compatibile

Items:
* Baedoor Encyclopaedia
  -> available only with Patchouli
* Disbandment Scroll
  -> once hiring mechanics are set, it will allow to disband hired warriors and citizens

Advancements:
* The Crusade Began
  -> given at the start [recipe/starter advancement]
--------
* Across the Dunes (Dune Path)
  -> given after visiting Dunes for the first time
--------
* Empire Foundation Set In... Woood (Empire Path)
  -> given after getting civilisation table

Integrations:
* Bone sabre is integrated with Wastelands of Baedoor sabre mechanics

Gamerules:
* overworldImpact
  -> config alternative for v0.a2
  -> decides whether structures spawn also in Overworld or not (affect civilisation cities, not implemented yet)
