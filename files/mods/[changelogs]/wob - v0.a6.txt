                             GENERATION:

                              CHANGED:

* changed firearm table GUI aesthetics
* crafting now uses buttons (used to fix bug BA5_0010)
* changed firearm table placing (you can place it in different rotations)
* added storage slots for keeping schemes in firearm table

* short revolver now uses 5-rounded revolver clip
  -> reload mechanics changed (reload delay stays the same though)
  -> short revolver recipe changed
* reload delay for long revolver shortened to 100 ticks (5s)
* shot delay for long revolver shortened to 15 ticks

* airships now generate in four types, each with different loot
  (later they will differ much more, even in aesthetics)
  -> bandit airships generate only in overworld
  -> trader airships generate slightly more common (350 instead of 250)
  -> old airship structures are now frozen (generating rate at 0)

* small bullet recipe gives you now 3 bullets instead of 2

                              BUGFIXES:

* BA5_0012 - "long revolver scheme" named as "short" one
* BA4_0008 - airship loot tables not working
* BA4_0009 - bandits not spawning on airships
* BA5_0010 - firearm table can dupe revolvers
