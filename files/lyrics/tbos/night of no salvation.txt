NIGHT OF NO SALVATION

It's easy to hide
Behind so many failures
What else I can find
In so distat world?

Keep searching warm
In unfamiliar faces
In unfamiliar touches
Bodies that leave no traces

Rejecting love I find
Rejecting my ideals
And nothing, comes to mind
Beyond the cold, empty land
In which memories - are like sand
And my journey - has no end
